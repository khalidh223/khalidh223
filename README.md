### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khalid Hussain, and I am currently a senior Computer Science major and Arabic minor at Carleton College, located in Northfield, MN.  I am currently interested in pursuing research within a master's degree program upon graduating. The research topics I am currently interested in include: Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, and the various applications of Deep Learning more broadly. Outside of research, I am also interested in full stack web development, and try to learn about deploying beautiful, responsive websites in my spare time (if I can get it).

-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - More about Deep Learning and its applications through Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101)
  - More about full stack web development w/ MongoDB and Express.js through Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy

-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on
  - Any web development projects in general, specifically within backend development; if it involves deploying any deep learning models, great!

  - Email: hussaink@carleton.edu
  - Or, connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khalid-hussain-029970176/)

-âš¡ Fun fact:
  - I love trail running in my college's own [arboretum](https://d31kydh6n6r5j5.cloudfront.net/uploads/sites/594/2020/12/2017B_WArbMapWithRules.pdf) whenever I can!
