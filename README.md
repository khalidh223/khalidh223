### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Khalid Hussain, and I am currently a senior Computer Science major and Arabic minor at Carleton College, located in Northfield, MN.  I am interested in full stack web development within a variety of frameworks, and in seeking employment as a Full Stack Web Developer. I also like Deep Learning and other applications of AI more broadly.

  - More about full stack web development w/ MongoDB and Express.js through Colt Steele's [Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/) on Udemy

  - Any web development projects in general, specifically within backend development, and within any development frameworks; if it involves deploying any deep learning models, great!
